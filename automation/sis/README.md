# SIS DataHub Pro Playwright acquisition

Raw SIS files, cookies and credentials are excluded from Git. The browser uses
its own persistent profile under `~/.local/share/nfl-dfs/sis-playwright`; CSVs
and manifests will live under the root-gitignored `sis/` directory.

One-time login:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[browser]"
playwright install chromium
sis-download login
sis-download verify-login
```

If the opened browser cannot accept keyboard input, cancel and use the secure
terminal fallback:

```bash
sis-download login --terminal-credentials
```

The password is read with hidden terminal input, used only to fill the SIS
login form, and discarded. It is never logged or written to the repository.

The bulk NFL exporter is being built around these fail-closed rules established
by the first trial files:

- every filter mutation must be followed by `Submit`;
- the rendered table must reflect the requested season/week/game scope before
  `Download`;
- the CSV must independently contain the expected Season/Week/Opponent/Games
  scope and differ from a prior broader query;
- `[object Object]` Rank is discarded;
- output at exactly the account limit (20 trial, documented 200 paid) is
  considered potentially truncated and must be split into narrower queries;
- raw CSVs remain local and a secret-free manifest records hashes, schemas,
  filters, row counts and retrieval times.

The first paid month is NFL-only. College acquisition is deferred to the 2027
CFB go/no-go review.
