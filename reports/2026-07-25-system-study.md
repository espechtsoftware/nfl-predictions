# System study: replayed picks, weekly confidence, and what actually matters

*2026-07-25. All results from season replays: models trained strictly on
seasons before the replayed one, projections built through the production
path (cold-start fill → components → simulation → calibration), scored
against actual DK points. Reproduce with `nfl-dfs replay --season N` and
the study scripts referenced at the bottom.*

## 1. What would we have picked in 2025, and how did it fare?

2025 has no real DK salaries (see the data deficiency log), so salaries
were **imputed** from a position + trailing-production model fit on
2014–2021 (~$96–196 per trailing point over a $2.2–4.3k base). Points are
real; the salary-cap constraint is approximate. 20 GPP entries per week,
core optimizer settings.

| Metric (17 weeks) | Result |
|---|---|
| Mean best-entry score | **181.7** |
| Best week | **248.4** (week 15) |
| Weeks best entry ≥ 190 | **5 / 17** |
| Weeks best entry ≥ 170 | 12 / 17 |
| Mean median-entry score | ~152 |

Against the ~190–200 "near the top" bar: the best of 20 entries clears it
roughly **once every 3–4 weeks**, and is in striking distance (170+) most
weeks. That's the honest shape of DFS: no projection system hits the
winning line weekly, because winning lineups require multiple tail
outcomes. The week-15 winner is instructive — the system's projections
were near-consensus (Hurts, CMC, Chase), and the 248 came from cheap
ceiling hits it deliberately rostered: Kyle Pitts ($3.8k imputed, 13.5
projected, **48.6 actual**) and Amon-Ra St. Brown (19.9 projected, 44.4
actual). The p90/ceiling objective on variation spots is doing its job.

For calibration: real 2021 salaries + the sharp simulated field put
double-up ROI at +51% (see README replay findings) — the cash-game
signal remains the more reliable evidence of edge than any GPP score.

## 2. Does confidence improve as the season unfolds?

Per-week averages across five replayed seasons (2018–2021, 2025). Week 1
never appears — every player needs ≥1 prior game to have features, which
is itself the honest answer about opening week.

| Window | MAE | Rank corr | Edge vs naive (MAE) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Early (W2–4) | 5.35 | 0.62 | **+0.89** |
| Late (W9+) | 5.15 | 0.61 | +0.23 |

Three findings, one of them counterintuitive:

1. **Absolute accuracy improves modestly** through the season (~4% MAE),
   flattening around week 8. Data accumulation helps, but multi-season
   priors mean the model never starts from scratch.
2. **Rank ordering doesn't improve** (~0.61 all season) — the model's
   ability to sort players is as good in September as December.
3. **The model's *edge* is largest early.** In weeks 2–4 the naive
   trailing-average is terrible (MAE 5.9–6.9) because samples are tiny,
   while the model leans on multi-season history, Vegas, roles, and draft
   capital. By late season simple heuristics catch up. Strategically:
   **early season is when this system is most valuable relative to the
   field**, not least — the intuition that "we should wait until we have
   more data" has it backwards, as long as bankroll sizing respects the
   slightly higher absolute error.

Calibration (p10 ≈ 8–9%, p90 ≈ 87–89%) is stable across all weeks.

## 3. Which metrics actually matter?

Two lenses on 2025 replays: drop-one-group ablations (retrain without a
feature group, measure MAE change) and LightGBM gain importances.

| Config | MAE | Δ vs full |
|---|---|---|
| Full model | 4.934 | — |
| minus Vegas (implied total, spread, script) | 4.982 | **+0.048** |
| minus production trail (dk_points_l4/std/vol) | 4.971 | +0.037 |
| minus usage (shares, WOPR, smoothed RZ) | 4.968 | +0.034 |
| minus role/next-man-up | 4.958 | +0.024 |
| minus defense (all allowed metrics) | 4.942 | +0.008 |
| minus salary | 4.921 | **−0.013** |

Gain importances (opportunity models): `wopr_l4` + `target_share_l4`
carry **67%** of the targets model; `carry_share_l4` alone is 60% of the
carries model.

Reading it honestly:

- **Opportunity metrics are the engine** (WOPR, shares, snaps). Ablation
  deltas look small only because feature groups are redundant — trailing
  production partially proxies usage — but the importances show where the
  models actually look.
- **Vegas is the least replaceable group**: nothing else encodes game
  environment.
- **Defense-allowed features contribute almost nothing** to projections
  (+0.008). This retroactively validates skipping paid DVOA — if our free
  defense metrics barely move MAE, a better version of them can't move it
  much either. (They remain useful for the dashboard/research layer.)
- **Salary is noise as a model feature** — removing it *helped* slightly.
  Plausible causes: 2022–2025 salary nulls degrade the splits, and salary
  is downstream of the same signals the model already has. Candidate for
  removal from the featureset at next retrain; keep `salary_delta_wow`
  under watch.
- The new role/next-man-up group (+0.024) earns its place — comparable to
  usage's marginal contribution despite being days old.

## 4. Salaried-season lineup scores (real salaries)

With real 2014–2021 salaries, same 20-entry GPP structure:

| Season | Weeks | Mean best entry | Max | Weeks ≥190 | Weeks ≥170 | Mean median entry |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2018 | 16 | 169.3 | 205.9 | 3 | 7 | 141.0 |
| 2019 | 16 | 165.4 | 222.6 | 4 | 7 | 138.0 |
| 2020 | 16 | 166.1 | 203.1 | 3 | 9 | 135.9 |
| 2021 | 17 | 161.9 | 199.5 | 2 | 8 | 134.8 |
| **All** | **65** | **165.6** | 222.6 | **12 (18%)** | 31 (48%) | 137.4 |

Under real salary constraints the best of 20 entries clears 190 about
**once every 5–6 weeks** and reaches 170+ about half the time. Note these
run ~15 points below the 2025 imputed-salary numbers — imputation smooths
real pricing inefficiencies in our favor, so treat the real-salary table
as the truthful baseline and the 2025 figures as directionally right but
flattering. Both are consistent with the +51–69% double-up ROI story:
this system's measurable edge is steadier accuracy, not weekly jackpot
lineups — exactly what cash games pay for and GPPs only occasionally do.
